## Module physical picture

## Overview

NL50 is a temperature sensor independently developed by our company. This temperature sensor uses the basic principle of diode to measure known temperature values. As the temperature rises, the voltage across the diode increases at a known rate. By accurately amplifying the voltage change, a voltage signal proportional to the ambient temperature is generated, thereby obtaining the corresponding temperature value.

Therefore, the NL50 sensor has the advantages of high accuracy and simple connection. It has a temperature range of ±5℃ from 0℃ to 85℃, which is more accurate than similar compatible devices on the market.
