# ESP32 Software Instructions

The purpose of this document is to introduce how to use the esp32 motherboard on Arduino IDE 2.0, Mixly, Mind+ and other platforms.

## 1. Download the program from the Arduino IDE

Please go to [the Arduino website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) to download the latest IDE 2.0 version

1. Open Ardunio IDE 2.0;
2. Install the ESP32 library;

1) Click on the Arduino IDE menu bar: [File] --> [Preferences]

*Copy the [URL of https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json](https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json) to the add-on manager address*
